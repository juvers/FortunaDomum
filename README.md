## Fortune-Homes

This is a quick attempt to create a property listing application in React. 

### Project Description

Key interests include, offline capacity of the app and security. If time permits this project will include the following: <br>
- Create the application with sorting and filtering capacity
- Ensure security of protected resources using JWT authentication at the initial layer, then solidifying with authorization based on access policies.
- A backend service will be designed usind node-express. Further security layers here will include the use of cors to prevent cross origin resource sharing. 
- Sequelize an orm will be used to prevent sql injection and keep the same philosophy in the database invocation design.
- If time permits this app will be hosted using an EC2 instance with mysql as the database for persistency. 
- The mysql will be in a private subnet creating another layer of security thereby inaccessible from 0.0.0.0/0
- Security groups will be created with rules giving access only as neccesary
