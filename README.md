This is a quick attempt to create a property listing application in React. 

### Project Description

Key interests include, offline capacity of the app and security. If time permits this project will include the following: <br>


- Create the application with sorting and filtering capacity
- Inlcude a map as property listings must have locations.
- Ensure security of protected resources using JWT authentication at the initial layer, then solidifying with authorization based on access policies.
- A backend service will be designed using node-express. Further security layers here will include the use of cors to prevent cross origin resource sharing. 
- Sequelize an orm will be used to prevent sql injection and keep the same philosophy in the database invocation design.
- If time permits this app will be hosted using an EC2 instance with mysql as the database for persistency. 
- Mysql will be in a private subnet creating another layer of security thereby inaccessible from 0.0.0.0/0
- Security groups will be created with rules giving access only as neccesary 
- Access control layers will also be introduced to further create a robust foolproof design

### ToDo:
- Use Bootstraps Flexbox for better layouts
- Use css grid if time permits
- Improve styling

#### N.B. Due to the multiple folder structure, I have decided to build the back end and authentication on a separate project to enhance surfing through folders.
